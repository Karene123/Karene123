***If you want to look at my projects involving Data Analysis, Data Collection, Data Mining, Data Visualization, Predictive Modeling, and the use of statistical machine learning algorithms:***   
 - ***Fall 2021: [ESG Project](https://github.com/Karene123/ESG-Project)*** where I designed and implemented a model utilizing: simple linear regression, the overall F-test, and transformation of some variables using log.
 - ***Fall 2022: [Women in the Labor Force](https://github.com/Karene123/Women_in_the_labor_force)*** where I utilized more complex models such as: Lasso and Ridge Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), K-nearest-neighbor (KNN).
 - ***Fall 2023: [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Karene123/Customer-Churn)*** where I designed and implemented a model utilizing: logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest.
   
***If you want to look at my projects involving my research:***
 - ***Fall 2021 - Spring 2023: [rmexact_analysis](https://github.com/gerardlab/rmexact_analysis)*** where I built statistical approaches using the Exact test and compared them with existing methods (Likelihood Ratio Test and Chi-Square).

***If you would like to review my work in building a package:***
- ***Spring 2022: [Sgroupr](https://github.com/gerardlab/rmexact_analysis)*** where I built a package to use finite abelian groups (you can find out more though this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_small_groups). The package can be used and includes a vignette with explanation on how to use the package.
  
***(Work in Progress)If you would like to see more of my recent project involving labor force participation in the United States since 1976 until 2015:***
