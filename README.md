***If you want to look at my projects involving Data Analysis, Data Collection, Data Mining, Data Visualization, Predictive Modeling, and the use of statistical machine learning algorithms:***   
 - ***Fall 2021: [ESG Project](https://github.com/Karene123/ESG-Project)*** By using the World Bank's Sovereign ESG Data Framework, the study provides crucial insights for policymakers and investors, demonstrating how a country's sustainability performance directly influences the health and longevity of its population. The findings from our multiple regression model can guide targeted interventions and investment decisions to improve global health outcomes.
 - ***Fall 2022: [Women in the Labor Force](https://github.com/Karene123/Women_in_the_labor_force)*** By analyzing data from the World Bank's Women, Business, and Law project, this work provides key insights into the legal barriers that prevent women from achieving economic equality. The findings from this model can directly inform policymakers on where to focus legislative reforms to improve women's labor force participation and economic rights.
 - ***Fall 2023: [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Karene123/Customer-Churn)*** Using the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset, my analysis provides a predictive model that identifies customers at high risk of leaving a telecommunications company. By proactively targeting these customers with tailored retention strategies, this work directly enables companies to significantly reduce churn and protect revenue.
 - ***Fall 2024: [Student Support](https://github.com/Karene123/Student_Support)*** By creating a database to track student performance and intervention outcomes, this project will provide valuable data on the effectiveness of personalized learning. The insights gained can directly inform educational strategies, helping institutions improve student success rates and retention in critical STEM fields
   
***If you want to look at my projects involving my research:***
 - ***Fall 2021 - Spring 2023: [rmexact_analysis](https://github.com/gerardlab/rmexact_analysis)*** where I built statistical approaches using the Exact test and compared them with existing methods (Likelihood Ratio Test and Chi-Square).

***If you would like to review my work in building a package:***
- ***Spring 2022: [Sgroupr](https://github.com/gerardlab/rmexact_analysis)*** where I built a package to use finite abelian groups (you can find out more though this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_small_groups). The package can be used and includes a vignette with explanation on how to use the package.
